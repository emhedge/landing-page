# Landing Page
I've created a default landing page, which would serve as a homepage for a website. For now, it serves as an opportunity to gain more familiarity with CSS/HTML and to solidify good habits.
In the coming weeks and months, I'll be returning here to update the page with more advanced HTML/CSS, JS, and unique content like images, text, and quotes.
